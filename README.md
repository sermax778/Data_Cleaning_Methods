# Data Cleaning and Analysis

Welcome to this data cleaning and analysis project! In this project, I've used custom datasets to understand various data cleaning techniques, handling missing data, and dealing with incorrect values. Below, I'll provide an overview of the key aspects of this project.

## Project Overview

I've created this project to gain a better understanding of data cleaning and analysis methods. I've used custom datasets to illustrate each step and technique clearly. Here's a breakdown of what we've covered:

### Datasets

- **weather_data.csv:** Our initial dataset used in the preparation phase and for handling missing data.
- **weather_data1.csv, weather_data2.csv, weather_data3.csv, weather_data4.csv:** These datasets were used sequentially to demonstrate techniques for dealing with incorrect values.

## Methods Explored

### Data Preparation and Missing Data Handling

We start with 'weather_data.csv' and explore methods to handle missing data:

- Filling missing values with specific values or NaN.
- Forward and backward filling to propagate valid values.
- Interpolation techniques to estimate missing values.
- Removing rows with missing values based on specific conditions.

### Techniques for Dealing with Incorrect Values

For 'weather_data1.csv' to 'weather_data4.csv,' we dive into techniques for correcting incorrect values:

- Replacing specific values with NaN to flag outliers.
- Replacing specific values with other values for consistency.
- Removing non-numeric characters from columns.
- Converting categorical values to numeric codes for analysis.

## How to Use This Project

Feel free to explore each dataset and the corresponding code. You can follow along with the steps and methods described in the code comments.
